##Challenges
The main challenge i am facing right now is how to program the winning conditions. i have a relative understanding of how to win condition will operate, but i do not understand how to code it.
##Takeaway
this homework has definately helped me understand the scale of work that will be done during the game week. 

I am frustrated that i couldn't figure out the logic behind the game, but i am hoping that i will understand in the coming days.
